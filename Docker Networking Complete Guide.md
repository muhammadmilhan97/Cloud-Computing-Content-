**# Docker Networking: Complete Guide**

**1. What is Docker Networking?**

Docker networking is a system that allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world. It enables containerized applications to interact over different types of networks efficiently. By default, Docker provides multiple networking options, each serving different purposes.

**Types of Docker Networks:**

1. **Bridge Network (Default)** – Allows communication between containers on the same host.
1. **Host Network** – Removes network isolation and uses the host machine’s network.
1. **Overlay Network** – Enables communication between containers running on different hosts (used in Docker Swarm).
1. **Macvlan Network** – Assigns a unique MAC address to each container, making it appear as a separate physical device.
1. **None Network** – No networking (completely isolated container).
-----
**2. What is Inter-Container Communication (ICC)?**

Inter-container communication (ICC) refers to the ability of Docker containers to talk to each other over a network. This is essential for **microservices architecture**, where different services (like a web server, database, and application backend) run in separate containers but need to exchange data.

**Why Do We Need Inter-Container Communication?**

When building containerized applications, different components (containers) must work together, such as:
✅ **Web Server (Nginx) communicating with an App Backend (Node.js/Python)**
✅ **Application Server interacting with a Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)**
✅ **Microservices communicating over REST APIs**

Docker networking enables **containers to communicate securely and efficiently** instead of exposing everything over the internet.


**How Inter-Container Communication Works in Docker?**

1. **Same Network:** Containers in the same network can communicate using container names as hostnames.
1. **Bridge Network (Default):** Containers get an internal IP and can talk to each other if connected.
1. **Custom Network:** Offers better control over communication and isolation.

**Why Did We Use Nginx in Docker Networking?**

In the practical guide, we deployed **Nginx** as an example **web server** inside a Docker network. The purpose was to demonstrate:

- How a service (web server) inside a container can **expose** itself to the network.
- How another container (e.g., an app backend) can **communicate** with the web server.
- How an external request (from a browser) can reach the service via localhost:8080.

This simulates real-world deployments where **frontend, backend, and databases run in separate containers** but communicate over a common network.

**Example: Web Server (Nginx) + Backend (Python Flask) Communication**

1️⃣   **Create a custom network**

` `docker network create my\_app\_network

2️⃣   **Run an Nginx Web Server**

` `docker run -d --name webserver --network=my\_app\_network -p 8080:80 nginx

3️⃣   **Run a Flask App in Another Container**

` `docker run -d --name backend --network=my\_app\_network python:3.9 sleep 1000

4️⃣   **Access Nginx from Flask**

` `docker exec -it backend ping webserver

This means the **backend can directly communicate with the web server** using the hostname webserver.

**3. Docker Networking: Step-by-Step Practical Guide**

This section will walk through setting up Docker networking with practical examples.

**Step 1: Install Docker**

Before working with Docker networking, Docker must be installed.

- **On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** 
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install docker.io -y
- sudo systemctl start docker
- sudo systemctl enable docker
- **On Windows/Mac:** Install **Docker Desktop** from the [official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Verify installation:

docker --version

-----
**Step 2: Check Default Docker Networks**

Docker comes with pre-configured networks. To list them, run:

docker network ls

**Expected Output:**

NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE  

xxxxxxxxxxx    bridge    bridge    local  

xxxxxxxxxxx    host      host      local  

xxxxxxxxxxx    none      null      local  

- **Bridge**: Default network that enables inter-container communication on the same host.
- **Host**: Uses the host’s network directly.
- **None**: Containers remain completely isolated.
-----
**Step 3: Create a Custom Docker Network**

To have better control over networking, we create a custom bridge network:

docker network create my\_network

Verify network creation:

docker network inspect my\_network

This command displays network details like subnet, gateway, and connected containers.

-----
**Step 4: Run Two Containers in the Same Network**

Run two containers inside the newly created network:

docker run -d --name container1 --network=my\_network nginx

docker run -d --name container2 --network=my\_network alpine sleep 1000

To check if container2 can reach container1, run:

docker exec -it container2 ping container1

If the ping is successful, it means both containers are connected within the same network.

-----
**Step 5: Expose a Web Service on Docker Network**

Now, let’s run an **Nginx web server** and expose it on port 8080:

docker run -d --name webserver --network=my\_network -p 8080:80 nginx

To verify, open a web browser and go to: 👉 [**http://localhost:8080**](http://localhost:8080/)

If you see the Nginx welcome page, your setup is working!

| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1|Installed Docker|Ensures Docker is available for networking setup|
|2|Listed default networks|Understand existing network configurations|
|3|Created a custom network|Provides isolated communication between containers|
|4|Connected containers to network|Enables inter-container communication|
|5|Exposed a web server|Demonstrates external access to a container service|

This guide gives a solid foundation for Docker networking. You can now build more complex containerized applications with custom networking setups.
